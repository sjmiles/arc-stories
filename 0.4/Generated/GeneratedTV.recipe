The show follows their dating lives and those of their three closest male friends. Michelle Penelope \"Shelly\" Williams, a beautiful and intelligent woman of the new generation trying to navigate the exhilarating world of 21st Century love, sex, romance and career. Shelly has been a little too single, a little too long for her own liking. Her two best friends, Rita (Ali Landry), a gorgeous, single former model, and Janie (Natalie Desselle-Reid), a woman very happy to be married and out of the dating scene, offer conflicting advice as Shelly tries to find her way on the rocky road to love. Representing the male side of the relationship equation is J.T. (Jason George), a handsome, regular kind of guy who really enjoys being single, and his best pal, Nick (Brian Hooks), who is looking for that one perfect woman who can meet his very exacting standards. Donovan Brink (Sean Maguire), the handsome, fashionable manager of Bedlam, one of Miami's hottest clubs, is friends with both Shelly and J.T. and inevitably gets stuck in the middle when problems arise.</p>","image":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/27/69606.jpg","name":"Eve","network":"UPN","showid":"7535","time":"20:30"},{"$id":"!497946570347455:app-shell-azozg1rlijypyo2p:0:inner:3","day":"","description":"","image":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/67/168682.jpg","name":"Eve Dönüş","network":"ATV","showid":"19253","time":""},{"$id":"!497946570347455:app-shell-azozg1rlijypyo2p:0:inner:4","day":"Tuesday","description":"<p>The future, probably Japan. Robots have long been put into practical use, and androids have just come into use. Influenced by the Robot Ethics Committee, it's become common sense for people to treat androids like household appliances. Their appearance - indistinguishable from humans except for the ring over each android's head - has led some people to empathize unnecessarily with androids. Known as \"android-holics\", such people have become a social problem. Rikuo, a high school student, has been taught from childhood that androids are not to be viewed as humans, and has always used them as convenient tools. One day Rikuo discovers some strange data in the behavior records of his family's household android, Sammy. Rikuo and his friend Masaki trace Sammy's movements, only to discover a mysterious café that features a house rule that \"humans and robots are to be treated the same\".</p>","image":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/29/74577.jpg","name":"Eve no Jikan","network":"Yahoo!
